# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that predicts *plant diseases from leaf images* using *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*. Early detection of plant diseases can help farmers take timely actions, prevent crop loss, and improve yield.  
The model is trained on the *PlantVillage Dataset* available on *Kaggle*, which contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves across multiple crop types.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a *deep learning model* capable of accurately identifying plant diseases from leaf images and classifying them into specific disease categories.

## 📂 Dataset Description
*PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle):*  
A large open-access dataset containing *50,000+ images* of healthy and diseased leaves from *38 different classes*.  
Each image belongs to a specific crop and disease type. Example categories include:
- Tomato — Healthy, Late Blight, Early Blight  
- Potato — Healthy, Late Blight, Early Blight  
- Apple — Healthy, Scab, Rust  
- Corn — Healthy, Northern Leaf Blight, Common Rust

## ⚙ System Workflow

1. *Data Collection:* Import images from the PlantVillage dataset.  
2. *Preprocessing:* Resize, normalize, and augment images to improve generalization.  
3. *Model Building:* Construct a CNN model using Keras Sequential API.  
4. *Training:* Train the model on the processed dataset.  
5. *Evaluation:* Measure model performance using accuracy metrics.  
6. *Prediction:* Use the trained model to classify new leaf images.
